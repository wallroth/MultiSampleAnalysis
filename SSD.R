## Spatio-Spectral Decomposition

## More general terminology explained (cf. Haufe et al. 2014)
# brain signals are measured in forms of activation patterns at channels + noise
# A = activation patterns; s = signals (isolated responses to stimulus), e = noise, X = measurement/data
# x = A*s(n)' + e(n) = forward (generative) model; s and e have length N (samples)
# each column of A represents the activation pattern for a certain signal
# i.e. a column vector of A (a) represents the strength of the signal in each channel
# A therefore has dimensions: channels x signals
# X is then a combination of activation patterns of superimposed signals (+ noise),
# e.g. for 1 signal: A(1:64,1) * S(1:N,1)' = [1:64,1:N] + e(1:64,1:N)
# for 5 signals: A(1:64,1:5) * S(1:N,1:5)' = [1:64,1:N] + e(1:64,1:N)
# -> values in A reflect the signal strength at different channels

# backward modeling tries to extract signals from measurements (reverse direction)
# W'*x(n) = s(n) = backward (discriminative) model
# W = transformation matrix/weights/spatial filters with dimensions: channels x signals
# usually we can assume signals < channels
# by projecting x(n) onto a column of W, each column (w) extracts one latent signal
# e.g. X(1:N,1:64) * W(1:64,1:5) = [1:N,1:5]
# the resulting columns are components which maximize similarity to a target (signal)
# and are a more informative lower-dimensional representation of the overall data
# filters (W) should amplify the signal of interest and suppress signals of no interest
# however W cannot be directly interpreted as it is a function of signal + noise
# -> transformation to A required!
# if W is a square matrix (64x64), A = the transpose of the inverse of W
# if W is not square because signals < channels, W is no longer invertible
# X must have full rank (signals are independent) & we assume noise to be uncorrelated to signal
# A = Cx * W * Cs^-1
# Cx = covariance of data; Cs = covariance of signals
# Cs is calculated with W' * Cx * W and has dimensions signals x signals
# -> W[1:64,1:5]' * Cx[1:64,1:64] * W[1:64,1:5] = Cs[1:5,1:5]
# -> Cx[1:64,1:64] * W[1:64,1:5] * Cs[1:5,1:5]^-1 = A[1:64,1:5]
# note: given A, we can also compute W = Cx^-1 * A * Cs
# if signals/components are uncorrelated (orthogonal): A = Cx * W

## Steps in the SSD framework:
#1. narrow bandpass filtering of target frequency, e.g. freq = 10-12; width=2
# this yields matrix Xs (signal) but includes noise
# width should be small (1-2 Hz) for better linear estimation of SNR
#2. flanking frequencies are min-width and max+width -> 8-10 and 12-14 Hz
# bandpass filtering from min-width : max+width and subtracting Xs yields Xn (noise)
# to get Xn one first bandpass filters the signal (e.g. 8-14Hz) and then uses 
# bandstop filtering with +/- 1 Hz transitions with respect to the bandpass (e.g. 9-13 Hz bandstop)
#3. estimation of time-averaged covariance matrices for Xs and Xn
# Cs = Xs' * Xs / N
# Cn = Xn' * Xn / N
# = covariance matrix with biased normalization factor (N instead of N-1)
# X = matrix(c(1,3,-7,3,9,2,-5,4,6), ncol=3, byrow=T)
# X0 = scale(X, scale=F) #sweep(X, 2, colMeans(X), "-") #demeaned X
# t(X0) %*% X0 / nrow(X0) #covariance with normalization factor N
# cov.wt(X, method="ML") #alternative implementation, or cov(X,1) in matlab
#4. find spatial filters with high variance at target frequency and low variance in noise freq
# generalized eigenvalue decomposition: Cs*w = Î»Cn*w
#5. obtain SSD components by projecting data onto the weights. Dimensionality can be reduced 
# by choosing only the first few components (ordered like in PCA)

  #frequencies: 4/6 (or 2) values in this order:
  #   - Signal bandpass: low, high; e.g. 10-12Hz 
  #   - Noise bandpass: low, high, surrounding the signal, e.g. 8-14Hz 
  #   - Noise bandstop: low, high; between signal and noise bp, e.g. 9-13Hz
  #     e.g. frequencies = c(10,12,8,14,9,13)
  #   if only 2 values, they are assumed as signal bandpass specification
  #   if 4 values, no bandstop is performed but instead the signal is subtracted
  #   from the noise (no transitions but likely to result in spectral leakage)
  #   at default, 6 frequencies will be set
  #noise.width: defines the width of the unattenuated noise range
  #             is used to calculate the noise band if only signal band is 
  #             specified. Otherwise the value is ignored.
  #signal.position: center, left, right; specifies if the frequency spectrum is closed to both sides
  #                 of the signal or open on one side. The noise bands will either surround the siganal
  #                 (center, default) or be only on the closed side of the signal spectrum
  #                 i.e. if left, the signal spectrum is open to the left and a noise band will only be
